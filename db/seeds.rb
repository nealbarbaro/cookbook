# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
  require "open-uri"
  require "twilio-ruby"


# Article.create(:title => "Foo", :content => "bar")

# ["A", "B", "C"].each do |l|
#   Author.create(:first_name => l)
# end
